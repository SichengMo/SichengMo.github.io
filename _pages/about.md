I am currently a second-year Master of Science student and incoming Ph.D. student in Computer Science at UCLA, where I am being advised by [Prof. Bolei Zhou](https://boleizhou.github.io/). I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, during which I conducted research under the guidance of [Prof. Yin Li](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~yli/) and [Prof. Fred Sala](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fredsala/).

My research lies in **Computer Vision**. I am particularly interested in large generative models for visual content generation and understanding. I also worked on scalable language-driven video understanding and 3D reconstruction before. 

In the past, my work extended to the field of machine learning, specifically on causal inference for Out-of-distribution generalization.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
