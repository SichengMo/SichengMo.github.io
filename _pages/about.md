[//]: # (I am currently a second-year Master of Science student and incoming Ph.D. student in Computer Science at UCLA, where I am being advised by [Prof. Bolei Zhou]&#40;https://boleizhou.github.io/&#41;. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, during which I conducted research under the guidance of [Prof. Yin Li]&#40;https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~yli/&#41; and [Prof. Fred Sala]&#40;https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fredsala/&#41;.)

I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at UCLA, where I am being advised by [Prof. Bolei Zhou](https://boleizhou.github.io/). I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, during which I conducted research under the guidance of [Prof. Yin Li](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~yli/) and [Prof. Fred Sala](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fredsala/).

My research lies in **Computer Vision**. I am particularly interested in large generative models for visual content generation and understanding. I also worked on scalable language-driven video understanding and 3D reconstruction before. 

In the past, my work extended to the field of machine learning, specifically on causal inference for Out-of-distribution generalization.
