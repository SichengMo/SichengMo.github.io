I am a first-year MS student in Computer Science at UCLA. I obtained my bachelor's degree of Computer Science and Mathematics at University of Wisconsin-Madison. I at that time researched under the supervision of [Prof.Yin Li](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~yli/) and [Prof.Fred Sala](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fredsala/)

My research interests are in Computer Vision and Machine learning. Specifically, I am particularly interested in video understanding and interpretable human-AI interaction.



<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
